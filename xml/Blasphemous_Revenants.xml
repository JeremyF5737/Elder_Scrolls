        <p>...not into the world, nor out of it, but between worlds they linger, held to the hearth and tomb by blood and loyalty. And if they 
        come unbidden, from love of kin or faith to duty, it is not unholy. It is but the answering of the ancestors, the awakening of 
        those who never sleep, the summoning to service of those bound through Hearth and House to the protection of the clan.</p>
        
        <p>But if sorcerers bring them forth, then such a summons is blasphemy, an abomination before the <group ref = "Ashlander">Tribes</group> and <location ref = "Tribunal Temple">Temple</location>, and a 
        sin so great that ages of burning cannot cleanse the fault. Abide not the sorcerer among you, for he comes to steal the bones 
        of your fathers and dust of your tombs. He seeks to bind by power what is yours by right, to drag forth the warm spirits from 
        their world between and bind them to their service like slaves and beasts.</p>
        
        <p>Who can know the shame of the dead, the ceaseless weeping of the necromancer's thrall? Cruel enough is the ancestor's 
        service given in love to Hearth and Kin. But <group ref = "Ancestor Ghost">ghost</group> or <group ref = "Ancestory Guardian">guardian</group>, <group ref = "Bonewalker">bonewalker</group> or <group ref = "Bonelord">bonelord</group>, summoned by profane ritual and 
        bound by force to the corpse miner's will, how may such a spirit ever find rest? How may it ever find its way back to its blood 
        and clan?</p>
        
        <p>Only a righteous <group ref = "Dunmer">Dunmer</group>, bound by blood to hearth and kin, bound by oath and service to the Temple, can call upon the 
        spirits of the Dunmer dead. Those foreign sorcerers of other races that invade our shores, shall they be permitted to rob our 
        tombs, to bind our kin-spirits into sorcerous slavery, to steal the lives of our dead as well as our land of the living? No, I say, 
        no, and no, three times more. Such necromancers must die, and their profane magicks must die with them.</p>
        
        <p>And shall we tolerate the hidden hosts of the undead, the arrogant princes of necromancers, the ancient <group ref = "Vampire">vampire</group> demons 
        who creep from their lairs in the West, seeking refuge in profane Daedric shrines, abandoned Dunmer Strongholds, 
        and corrupted subterranean labyrinths of the detested <group ref = "Dwemer">Dwemer</group> race? For ages the Great Houses and the Temple have kept our 
        land clean of the vampire's taint, but now these undead lords and their vile cattle have returned. These vampires die, and 
        their corrupt cattle with them, and their blood taint must be forever erased by fire and stake.</p>
