        <p>I have been asked to write this guidebook for outsiders who are unfamiliar with the
                <location ref="Tribunal Temple" visitable="yes">Tribunal Temple</location>, and
            interested in joining.</p>

        <p>All those who are earnest, and who are willing to submit to the wisdom of Blessed <person
                ref="Almsivi">Almsivi</person>, Triune Grace, the saints, and the priests, are
            welcome to the Fellowship of the <location ref="Tribunal Temple" visitable="yes"
                >Tribunal Temple</location>. The Temple is the religion of <location ref="Morrowind"
                visitable="yes">Morrowind</location> and Dunmer people, and has been for generation
            upon generation. With guidance and counsel of Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil, the
            Anticipations, and all the hosts of saints of ancestors, the Temple guards and protects
            the lands and peoples of <location ref="Morrowind" visitable="yes"
            >Morrowind</location>.</p>

        <p>Those who follow the Tribunal must have the Personality to lead others and the Willpower
            to resist the world's temptations. When violence is needful, we fight with staves and
            hammers, armored only in our faith. We study Restoration and Alchemy to heal the people,
            and Mysticism to learn more of the divine. We must also study Conjuration to speak with
            the spirits of our ancestors and protect against those who traffic with the Four
            Corners.</p>

        <p>Those interested in joining the <location ref="Tribunal Temple" visitable="yes">Tribunal
                Temple</location> should speak to priests at the temples in <location ref = "Ald'ruhn" visitable = "yes">Ald'ruhn</location>, <location ref = "Balmora" visitable = "yes">Balmora</location>, <location ref = "Molag" visitable = "yes">Molag</location>
            Mar, and Ghostgate, or with priests at the High Fane in the Temple Compound in Vivec
            City.</p>

        <p>Articles of Faith</p>
        <p>The Temple believes that Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil were mortal guardians of
                <location ref="Morrowind" visitable="yes">Morrowind</location> who walked the earth,
            defeated the Dunmer's greatest enemies, the <group ref="Nords">Nords</group> and the
                <group ref="Dwarves">Dwarves</group>, and achieved divine substance through
            superhuman discipline and virtue and supernatural wisdom and insight. Like loving
            ancestors, they guard and counsel their followers. Like stern parents, they punish sin
            and error. Like generous relatives, they share their bounty among the greatest and
            least, according to their needs.</p>

        <p>Duties of the Faithful</p>
        <p>Your fourfold duties are to: Faith, Family, Masters, and all that is good. Perform holy
            quests and bring luster to the Temple. Never transgress against your brothers or
            sisters, and never dishonor your house or your ancestors. Serve and protect the poor and
            weak, and honor your elders and clan.</p>

        <p>For those who would be wise, these sacred books will be of interest.</p>

        <p>Saryoni's Sermons Learn from the teachings of Vivec, and from the Archcanon's sermons on
            the Seven Graces.</p>

        <p>Lives of the Saints Members of the Temple who wish to be virtuous will model their lives
            on the lives of the saints.</p>

        <p>The Pilgrim's Path The path to wisdom and self-knowledge is through pilgrimage. Those who
            would rise in the ranks of the faithful may retrace the steps of the Lords and Saints,
            and gain blessings and learn virtue by suffering and overcoming hardships.</p>

        <p>The Consolations of Prayer Learn what bounties and blessing might be gained by prayer at
            the shrines found in temples, and in places of pilgrimage, and in the tombs of our
            ancestors.</p>
