        <p>Council Actions</p>

        <p>In response to repeated protests from <person ref="Duke Vedam Dren">Duke Dren</person>
            and representative of the other Great Houses, Telvanni Council reminded them that,
            according to ancient law and custom, Telvanni Council places no constraint on the
            ambitions and enterprise of its individual members. If the Empire or other House
            Councils wish to dispute Telvanni exploration and colonization of the wastes and
            wildernesses of Vvardenfell, they are welcome to do so, with the Councilors' best
            wishes, but Telvanni Council will not contribute its resources or authority to such
            endeavors.</p>

        <p>The council renews its objection to proposals placed before <person ref="Duke Vedam Dren"
                >Duke Dren</person> and the Grand Council concerning slavery and slave trading in
            Vvardenfell District. The right to own and trade slaves is guaranteed by the terms of
            the Treaty of the Armistice, and Telvanni Council will not entertain any discussion of
            abridgements of those rights. </p>
