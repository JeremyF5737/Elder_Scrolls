        <p>What is the <group ref="Imperial Cult">Imperial Cult</group>?</p>


        <p> The missionary arm of the great faiths, the <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial
                cult</group> brings divine inspiration and consolation to the Empire's remote
            provinces. The cults combine the worship of the Nine Divines, the <person
                ref="Aedra Akatosh">Aedra Akatosh</person>, <person ref="Dibella">Dibella</person>,
                <person ref="Arkay">Arkay</person>, <person ref="Zenithar">Zenithar</person>,
                <person ref="Mara">Mara</person>, <person ref="Stendarr">Stendarr</person>, <person
                ref="Kynareth">Kynareth</person>, and <person ref="Julianos">Julianos</person>, and
            the <person ref="Talos">Talos</person> cult, veneration of the divine god-hero Tiber
            Septim, founder and patron of the Empire. <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial
                cult</group> priests provide worship and services for all these gods at Imperial
            shrines in settlements throughout <location ref = "Vvardenfell" visitable = "yes">Vvardenfell</location>.</p>

        <p> What is the Virtuous Life?</p>


        <p> Our doctrines are simple. We acknowledge the divinity of the Nine Divines: Akatosh,
                <person ref="Dibella">Dibella</person>, <person ref="Arkay">Arkay</person>, <person
                ref="Zenithar">Zenithar</person>, <person ref="Mara">Mara</person>, <person
                ref="Stendarr">Stendarr</person>, <person ref="Kynareth">Kynareth</person>, <person
                ref="Julianos">Julianos</person>, and Tiber Septim. We preach the Nine Virtues:
            Humility, Inspiration, Piety, Work, Compassion, Justice, Ambition, Learning, and
            Civility. Our Emperor is the Defender of the Faith, and the Empire is the worldly
            working of the Divine Plan. We pledge aid and comfort to all citizens in need, and serve
            the Emperor and Empire at his will.</p>

        <p> The <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group>s look to the Nine Divines as models
            for living a good and virtuous life. Each of the Nine represents different aspects of
            life, and how it should be lived. But the simplest statement of our doctrines is -- help
            and protect one another. The stronger one is, the wealthier one is, the more one bears
            responsibility for helping and protecting others. One's first duty, of course, is to
            one's fellow members of the <group ref="Imperial Cult">Imperial Cult</group>. But after
            that, one should help and protect any needy persons.</p>

        <p> We also say, "do not harm one another." It is forbidden to attack another person of the
                <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group>, and of course, forbidden to kill
            another member. It is forbidden to steal from another member, whether by open theft or
            by covert pickpocketing. It is forbidden to trespass upon the private property of
            another member. Break any one of these rules, and be expelled from the cult.</p>

        <p> How can I join the <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group>?</p>


        <p> The <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group> accepts all citizens of good
            character and earnest faith. We ask only a one-time pledge of 50 drakes to aid us in our
            good works. Thereafter, the only cost of membership comes when you use our health,
            healing, and blessing shrines -- modest fees which help us spread the blessings of the
            Nine to those less fortunate than ourselves.</p>

        <p> Those who wish to join the <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group> in
            <location ref = "Vvardenfell" visitable = "yes">Vvardenfell</location> will find a warm welcome from our cult greeters: Ygfa at Fort <location ref = "Pelagiad" visitable = "yes">Pelagiad</location>,
            Syloria Siruliulus at <location ref = "Buckmoth Legion Fort" visitable = "yes">Buckmoth Legion Fort</location>, Somutis Vunnis at <location ref = "Moonmoth Legion Fort" visitable = "yes">Moonmoth Legion Fort</location>,
            <location ref = "Ruccia Conician" visitable = "yes">Ruccia Conician</location> in the Grand Council Chambers in Ebonheart, or <location ref = "Lalatia Varian" visitable = "yes">Lalatia Varian</location> in the
            Imperial Chapels at Ebonheart.</p>

        <p> What are the requirements for advancement in the <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial
                cult</group>?</p>


        <p> Seekers who wish to advance in the service of the Nine must dedicate time and resources
            to serving the cult, and must strive for personal improvement in their attributes and
            skills. Only the most distinguished are worthy of advancement to the higher ranks in the
                <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group>s.</p>

        <p> To serve and glorify the Nine Divines, the faithful must cultivate a noble personality
            and a strong will. Respect the magical arts, especially the colleges of Restoration,
            Mysticism, and Conjuration. Those who swear to avoid bloodshed, to take the field
            unarmored to fight only with blunt weapons, are especially praiseworthy. Knowledge of
            enchantments and the gift of diplomatic speech are other qualities we value in our
            initiates.</p>

        <p>

            may pray at <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group> healing altars and receive
            blessings which cure common and blight diseases, cure poisons, and restore damaged

        <p> Opportunities for service</p>


        <p> Lay healers gather ingredients for health and healing potions, and minister to the sick
            and hurt in poor and isolated communities. It is difficult and sometimes dangerous work,
            but the spiritual rewards are great. Lay healers need only the skills of the prudent
            traveler, being often on the road and in the wilderness, gathering herbs and potion
            components. They should avoid trouble where possible, and so need not be masters of the
            arts of war. Those interested should speak to Synnolian Tunifus at the Imperial Chapels
            in <location ref = "Ebonheart" visitable = "yes">Ebonheart</location>.</p>

        <p> Almoners gather alms from members and friends of the faith. We depend on donations to
            fund most of our good works. Almoners who are successful at bringing in generous
            donations may rise in the ranks of <group ref="Imperial Cult">Imperial Cult</group>s
            service. Almoners must travel in town and village, and should be skilled in persuasion
            and mercantile matters. Also, almoners with personal wealth are in a position to better
            serve the cult. Those interested should speak to <person ref = "Iulus Truptor">Iulus Truptor</person> at the Imperial Chapels
            in <location ref = "Ebonheart" visitable = "yes">Ebonheart</location>.</p>

        <p> A shrine sergeant helps keep order at the shrines, carries messages and packages, and
            sometimes escorts priests and lay servants on dangerous missions. This occasional
            service is ideal for bold, free-spirited adventurers. Shrine sergeants are called upon
            to serve the Nine with weapon, armor, and spell. New shrine sergeants are given the
            easiest tasks, but later, missions may demand higher levels of combat proficiency. Those
            interested should speak to <person ref = "Kaye">Kaye</person> at the Imperial Chapels in <location ref = "Ebonheart" visitable = "yes">Ebonheart</location>.</p>

        <p> Oracle's Quests are the most demanding of all <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial
                cult</group> missions. Only members of the higher ranks are invited to assist the
            Oracle, and the challenges require the skill and courage found only in heroes of
            legend.</p>

        <p> How do the <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group>s view the other factions of
            <location ref = "Vvardenfell" visitable = "yes">Vvardenfell</location>? The <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group>s have a very close
            relationship with the Imperial legions, and a friendly and supportive relationship with
            the Imperial Guilds -- especially the <group ref="Fighters">Fighters</group> and <group
                ref="Mages Guild">Mages Guilds</group>. We also have a friendly and supportive
            relationship with House Hlaalu, which strongly supports the Emperor and Imperial
            principles. Though we cannot condone the actions of the Thieves Guild, we praise their
            faithful dedication to the Emperor and to Imperial culture.</p>

        <p> The <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group>s have the greatest respect for the
            high moral principles of House Redoran and the <group ref="Morag Tong">Morag
                Tong</group>, and honors their different but noble conceptions of Divine
            Inspiration.</p>

        <p> We disapprove of the primitive heathen beliefs of the <group ref="Ashlanders"
                >Ashlanders</group>, and of the impious and inhumane practices of the <group
                ref="Telvanni">Telvanni</group>. The <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial
                cult</group> especially disapproves of the practice of slavery, and looks forward to
            the day when slavery is illegal in all Imperial provinces. The <group
                ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group> also disapproves of the lawless and greedy
                <group ref="Camonna Tong">Camonna Tong</group>, and their ruthless exploitation of
            the poor and weak.</p>

        <p> Historically, our relationship with the Tribunal Temple is difficult and unfriendly.
            Though the <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial cult</group>s acknowledges the lords and
            saints of the Temple pantheon as worthy inspirations, the Temple falsely insists that
            theirs is the One True Faith, and that the <group ref="Imperial cult">Imperial
                cult</group>s worship false gods.</p>
