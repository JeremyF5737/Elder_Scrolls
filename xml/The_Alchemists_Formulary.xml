        <p>Adventurers' Recipes</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the potions most favored by adventurers require more rare and expensive ingredients. There are exceptions, like the easy and affordable recipe for fire shield. But most such potions require at least one ingredient with high cost in coin or blood.</p>

        <p>An adventurer can fortify his strength with a potion made from <object><item ref="ash_yams">ash yams</item></object> and <object><item ref="dreugh_wax">dreugh wax</item></object>.

Bittergreen is a red flowering plant growing in the <location ref ="Red_Mountain" visitable ="yes">Red Mountain</location> region. <object><item ref="diamonds">diamonds</item></object>, on the other hand, are very rare and expensive and usually must be purchased from fine alchemists.</p>
