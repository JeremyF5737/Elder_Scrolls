Falanaamo, my friend:

I was wondering if you could send me an order of those new Netch Leather Shoes you were raving about last night. Come by the Shovel anytime for a round on the house. You really must tell me more about your past on Summerset Isle sometime, although next time I hope you're sober enough to make some sense!
