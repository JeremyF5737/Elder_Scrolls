Valvius,

I am sorry to inform you that your order for six more crates of Cyrodilic Brandy has been turned down due to your belated payment on the last shipment I sent you. As soon as I receive the balance owed of 3645 gold pieces, I will reconsider my current position. Please expedite your payment and we can avoid trouble from the local "authorities".

Sincerely,
Irgola the Pawnbroker
