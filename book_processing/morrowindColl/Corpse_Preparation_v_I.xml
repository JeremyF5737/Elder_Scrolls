        <p>While the Arts of Necromancy are only illegal in the province of <location ref = "Morrowind" visitable = "yes">Morrowind</location>, few citizens
            of the <group ref = "Empire">Empire</group> have an enlightened view of our Art. Thus, the acquisition of corpses on
            which to experiment is often difficult.</p>

        <p>In <location ref = "Cyrodiil" visitable = "yes">Cyrodiil</location>, a few Necromancers who have served the <group ref = "Empire">Empire</group> are given the corpses of
            criminals and traitors to use legally. This provides those who have acquired such a post
            with a fresh supply of corpses, most of them young, strong, and intact.</p>

        <p>In <location ref = "Morrowind" visitable = "yes">Morrowind</location>, the outlawing of Necromancy would make its practice impossible were it not
            for the fortunate institution of slavery. While the Temple will investigate obvious
            signs of Necromancy such as hastily emptied graves or ash stolen from one of their
            ashpits, a careful and discrete Necromancer can thrive in <location ref = "Morrowind" visitable = "yes">Morrowind</location> by taking slaves at
            a modest rate. Most will assume the slave escaped or died in the <location ref = "Ashlands" visitable = "yes">Ashlands</location>.</p>

        <p>Finding suitable corpses in <location ref = "Black Marsh" visitable = "yes">Black Marsh</location> is nearly impossible due to their rapid decay.
            There are also diseases, <group ref = "Argonian">Argonian</group> tribesmen, and other difficulties that must be dealt
            with. I know of only a few <group ref = "Sload">Sload</group> Necromancers who operate successfully in <location ref = "Black Marsh" visitable = "yes">Black Marsh</location>,
            and even they stay near coast.</p>

        <p>While the forests of <location ref = "Elsweyr" visitable = "yes">Elsweyr</location> pose some of the same problems as those of <location ref = "Black Marsh" visitable = "yes">Black Marsh</location>, the
            deserts preserve corpses for hundreds of years in a way that requires very little
            preparation. <group ref = "Khajiit">Khajiit</group> of the desert tribes are often buried with only a small cairn of
            stones which are easy to find and uncover. The <group ref = "Khajiit">Khajiit</group> show remarkably enlightened
            indifference to graves being uncovered. It is said that in the port of Senchal, one may
            purchase anything one desires. This is true if you desire fresh corpses.</p>

        <p>While few Bosmer perform Arkay's rituals when burying the dead, the more primitive Bosmer
            still practice cannibalism upon their enemies, which reduces the number of available
            corpses. As would be expected from such a backwards people, they have an intolerance of
            Necromancy that goes beyond all reason. Many Necromancers who practice our Arts in
            Valenwood become "one with the trees" themselves.</p>

        <p><location ref = "Summerset Isle" visitable = "yes">Summerset Isle</location> is even worse in some ways. Some <group ref = "Altmer">Altmer</group> born into the most respected noble
            and scholarly families are actually allowed to study the dead in the open. Their
            research, however, seems to be centered on finding ways to extend their lives even
            further rather than the more practical uses of our Art. A Necromancer of any other race
            caught in <location ref = "Summerset Isle" visitable = "yes">Summerset Isle</location> can expect the worst possible punishments.</p>

        <p>In Hammerfell, where worship of Arkay is strongest, the dead are almost always subject to
            Arkay's Law. There are exceptions after large battles or in remote areas where death
            occurs far from meddlesome priests. Fortunately, the dangerous terrain and creatures in
            the deserts and mountains of Hammerfell makes the acquisition of corpses possible,
            though they are often in poor condition and require special care in preparation.</p>

        <p>The newly formed <location ref = "Orsinium" visitable = "yes">Orsinium</location> presents a unique opportunity. As you know, <group ref = "Orc">Orc</group> corpses are
            among the most sought after for the durability of their skin and the strength of their
            bones. If <person ref = "King Gortwog">King Gortwog</person> will listen to reason, we could offer the services of our Art in
            defense of his young nation in exchange for disposing of the <group ref = "Orc">Orc</group>ish dead. A mutually
            beneficial arrangement as I'm sure the <group ref = "Orc">Orc</group>s will agree. To this end, a delegation has
            been sent to <location ref = "Orsinium" visitable = "yes">Orsinium</location>, though we have not yet heard any word on the state of these
            negotiations.</p>

        <p>In my native <location ref = "High Rock" visitable = "no">High Rock</location>, traditions dating back to the witch kings and nomadic horsemen
            mandate cremation of the dead. This is practiced almost without exception in the north,
            through an Imperial burial in a tomb or city cemetery is more common in the south. There
            are still many corpses easily taken from the battlefields of the War of Betony and the
            lawless times that followed. There are even rumors that King Gothryd of Daggerfall may
            institute the Imperial practice of donating the corpses of criminals for Necromantic
            study as a deterrent to the bandits and pirates that still threaten the Iliac Bay.</p>

        <p>In Skyrim, the cold weather and isolated terrain allow a few Necromancers to operate
            freely. Alas, the availability of corpses is limited to <group ref = "Nords">Nords</group> who die from exposure or
            in battle. While the cold is preservative, the snow makes these corpses difficult to
            find. More research dedicated to the magical detection of corpses would be invaluable to
            the Necromancers of Skyrim.</p>

        <p>The <group ref = "Sload">Sload</group> are the most famous Necromancers, but little is known of their native <location ref = "Thras" visitable = "no">Thras</location>. In
            Tamriel, <group ref = "Sload">Sload</group> only practice Necromancy on other races. It is uncertain whether this is
            true in <location ref = "Thras" visitable = "no">Thras</location> as well. If so, it would explain the number of slaves that are purchased
            in <location ref = "Tear" visitable = "no">Tear</location> by <group ref = "Sload">Sload</group> merchants and the rumors of <group ref = "Sload">Sload</group> airships carrying corpses from
            Senchal.</p>

        <p>These difficulties lead many Necromancers to create their own corpses. While I prefer to
            work with those who have died a natural death, a more expedient approach is sometimes
            necessary to further the study of the Art.</p>

        <p>While the Arts of Necromancy can be practiced on animals, such experiments rarely produce
            interesting results. The servant's ability to follow directions seems to be related to
            the subject's intelligence in life. While raising the corpse of a man, elf, or beastman
            can produce a useful servant, the corpses of animals produce mere guard dogs at best.
            Often a raised animal is unable to distinguish its master from the rest of the living
            and many amateur practitioners have been torn apart by the animal servants they created.
            Let such stories be a lesson to you.</p>
