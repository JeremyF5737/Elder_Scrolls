        <p>"The Test of Pattern requires the observer to examine and analyze for patterns before he
            acts, with the understanding that many patterns are subtle or hidden.</p>
        
        <p>"The Test of Disorder requires the observer to proceed systematically when no pattern is perceived. When
        the observer recognizes that many things must be done, and in no specific order; the
        procedure is to perceive and order all the things to be done, and, upon doing a thing, to
        recall how and when that thing has been done. For example, the observer must remember the
        initial position of a thing, and also the new position of that thing.</p> 
        
        <p>"The Test of Evasion requires the observer to examine the obstacle, and compare his resources and abilities; if
        the obstacle is too difficult, seek for a path around the difficulty.</p> 
       
       <p>"The Test ofConfrontation requires the observer to examine the obstacle, and compare his resources and
        abilities; if the obstacle is too difficult, look for a path around the difficulty... but if
        no path around can be found, confront the obstacle directly."</p>
