        <p> ...and upon that year of the Reign of <person ref="Wulfharth">Wulfharth</person> and his Son's, the Magnificence that
            was Mordrin Hanin ended in this world. Representative of <location ref="Ashalmawia" visitable="yes">Ashalmawia</location>, <location ref="Maelkashishi" visitable="yes">Maelkashishi</location> and <location ref="Ald Sotha" visitable="yes">Ald Sotha</location> gathered in a great host at the vastness of <location ref="Assurnabitashpi" visitable="yes">Assurnabitashpi</location>. Even Hilbongard and
            Dorach Gusal were lured from their Forge, and for a time the Fires of <location ref="Anudnabia" visitable="yes">Anudnabia</location> were silent.
        </p>
        
       <p> And thus on the Ninth Day of Mourning, many slaves and enemies were sacrificed and the Cup
        of Passage was mixed according to the direction of Hanin's Formulae:</p>
        
       <p> 2 Parts Blood of Traitors
           1 Part <object><item ref="Daedra's Heart">Daedra's Heart</item></object> of <group ref="Daedra">Daedra</group>
           1 Part mixed Bittergreen Petals, <object><item ref="Void Salts">Void Salts</item></object>, <object><item ref="Green
               Lichens">Green
           Lichens</item></object> and <object><item ref="Bonemeal">Bonemeal</item></object>
           1 Part <object><item ref="Moonsugar">Moonsugar</item></object> 
           5 Parts <object><item ref="Flin">Flin</item></object></p>
        
        <p> Combine Blood, <object><item ref="Daedra's Heart">Heart</item></object>, <object><item ref="Moonsugar">Moonsugar</item></object> in Large Ebony <object><item ref="Alembic">Alembic</item></object>. Heat fire fed by Bones of Traitors. Condense vapors into a large Ebony flask.
            For a hot drink, strain contents through <object><item ref="Scamp Skin">Scamp Skin</item></object> and mix with <object><item ref="Flin">Flin</item></object> in large mug, slowly
            stirring with a glass rod. For a chilled drink, mix in flask with pure <location ref="Skyrim" visitable="no">Skyrim</location> Ice and shake
            vigorously. Strain through <person ref="Winged Twilight">Winged Twilight</person> membrane and served in gem encrusted goblet. 
        </p>
      
       <p>The wake was considered a great success as the beverage killed a great many guests and thus
        Mordrin Hanin was supplied with companions in the next world.</p> </contents>
