        <p><group ref="Undead">Undead</group> commonly occur in three basic types: spirit, flesh, and fleshless. Spirit
            revenants like the <group ref="ancestor ghost">ancestor ghost</group>, wraith, and dwarven ghost, can only be harmed by
            weapons that are enchanted or made of refined substances such as silver. <group ref="Ancestor
                ghosts">Ancestor
                ghosts</group>, the most common spirit revenant, are harmless, apart from the minor curses they
            lay upon their victims. Wraiths are similar to ghosts, but they are capable of
            inflicting wounds to the careless explorer. <group ref="Ancestor
                ghosts">Dwarven ghosts</group> are more dangerous still, but
            they generally appear only in <location ref="Dwarven ruins" visitable="yes">Dwarven ruins</location>.</p>
        
        <p>Flesh revenants, or '<group ref="zombies">zombies</group>' as they are often called in the West, are known as
            '<group ref="bonewalkers">bonewalkers</group>' in <location ref="Morrowind" visitable="yes">Morrowind</location>. Magic preserves the <group ref="bonewalker's">bonewalker's</group> fleshy remains along with
            the bones and spirit. <group ref="Bonewalkers">Bonewalkers</group> are readily identified by the sharp protuberances of
            bone and metal employed in the rituals that bind them to this plane. All <group ref="bonewalkers">bonewalkers</group> are
            malevolent and dangerous, but the greater <group ref="bonewalkers">bonewalkers</group> are far worse than the more common
            'lesser' <group ref="bonewalkers">bonewalkers</group>. Thankfully, normal weapons harm <group ref="bonewalkers">bonewalkers</group>.</p>
        
        <p>It is difficult to generalize about fleshless revenants, or <group ref="skeletons">skeletons</group>. The agility and fighting ability of
            the animated remains may depend on the abilities of the <group ref="skeletons">revenant's</group> former life, and may
            therefore be weak or strong, or more or less capable with weapons and shields. Fortunately,
            enchanted weapons are not needed to destroy <group ref="skeletons">skeletons</group>. An exception is the <group ref="skeletons">bonelord</group>, a
            peculiar form of revenant that seems to derive its powers more from its spirit energies than
            from the substance of its skeletal remains. <group ref="Bonelords">Bonelords</group> are very powerful, and very dangerous.
            Normal weapons do not affect them.</p>
        
        <p><group ref="Vampires">Vampires</group> were believed to be extinct in <location ref="Morrowind" visitable="yes">Morrowind</location> for
            centuries. <group ref="Dark Elves">Dunmer</group> culture has a special hatred for <group ref="vampires">vampires</group>, and in earlier times the
            <group ref="Ordinators">Ordinators</group> and <group ref="Buoyant Armigers">Buoyant Armigers</group> hunted them to extinction. In recent years, however,
            <group ref="vampires">vampires</group> have either begun to sneak into <location ref="Morrowind" visitable="yes">Morrowind</location>, or long-dormant ones have been awakened.
            <group ref="Vampires">Vampires</group> vary in their substance and power according to their age and accumulated lore, but
            even the weakest <group ref="vampire">vampire</group> is immeasurably stronger than most other undead. Note: <group ref="Ash vampires">Ash vampires</group>
            are not vampires, and are not undead. <group ref="Ash vampires">Ash vampires</group> are extremely dangerous. While their
            spirit and substance may indeed be preserved by some magical process, the holy warriors of
            the <group ref="Tribunal Temple">Tribunal Temple</group> report that spell effects known to affect the undead have no effect on
            <group ref="ash vampires">ash vampires</group>.</p>
