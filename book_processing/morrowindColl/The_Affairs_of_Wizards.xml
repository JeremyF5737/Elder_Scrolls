        <p>Want to Become Part of<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group>?</p>
        <p>Outsiders learning of the rabid isolationist and outlander-hating temperament of<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group> wizards often assume it would be impossible to obtain positions in service to<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group>.</p>
        <p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
        <p>For example, since the Telvanni vigorously defend the right to own slaves, and since they keep many<group ref=" Argonian"> Argonian</group> and <group ref=" Khajiit"> Khajiit</group> as slaves, many<group ref=" Argonian"> Argonian</group>s and <group ref=" Khajiit"> Khajiit</group> assume they would not be accepted for service with<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group>.</p>
        <p>Not true. Telvanni accept all races as candidates for membership.</p>
        <p>And, since the Telvanni are ruled by wizard-lord nobles, many assume they accept only candidates of the highest intelligence and willpower.</p>
        <p>Not true. Telvanni accept candidates of modest intelligence and willpower.</p>
        <p>It is true that advancement in Telvanni ranks depends on high intelligence and willpower, and that candidates proficient in the arts of magic -- especially Mysticism, Conjuration, Illusion, Alteration, Destruction and Enchanting - can expect to advance faster and higher in the ranks.</p>
        <p>But adventurers of all races and abilities who apply to Telvanni Mouths at the <location ref ="Telvanni Council Hall" visitable ="yes">Telvanni Council Hall</location> in <location ref ="Sadrith Mora" visitable ="yes">Sadrith Mora</location> for acceptance in<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group> can expect a cordial welcome.</p>
        <p>(Telvanni Councilors do not serve on their house councils in person. Instead, they are represented by a 'Mouth', a trusted subordinate in residence at the Council Hall, acting on his patron's behalf, receiving messengers from their patrons and casting their patron's votes in Council affairs.)</p>
        <p>The truth is that<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group> wizard-lords depend on loyal, well-paid, skilled retainers for most services. Though<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group> does recruit from their own lower classes, they must go outside their house to hire the craftsmen and specialists they need. And since for political reasons<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group> has chosen to reduce its reliance on <group ref="Redoran">Redoran</group> mercenaries for protection and security, it has been forced to turn to Western mercenaries for guards and agents.</p>
        <p>Promotion in the ranks of<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group>, however, is very difficult for outsiders. Most disconcerting for some potential candidates is<group ref=" House Telvanni"> House Telvanni</group>'s casual acceptance of murder and assassination of rivals as a means to advancement. Those reluctant to prove their worthiness by killing off the competition, and those uncomfortable about competing in such a ruthless atmosphere, might better employ their time and efforts in the <group ref="Mages Guild">Mages Guild</group>.</p>
