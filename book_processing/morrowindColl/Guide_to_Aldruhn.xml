        <p> Principle Districts of <location ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn</location></p>
        <p>
            <location ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn</location> is the district seat of
            House Redoran, and one of the largest settlements on <location ref="Vvardenfell"
                visitable="yes">Vvardenfell</location>. The three principal districts are <location
                ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn</location> town, <location ref="Ald'ruhn"
                visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn</location>-under-Skar, and <location ref="Buckmoth Fort"
                visitable="yes">Buckmoth Fort</location>.</p>

        <p>
            <location ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn</location> town is a large settlement
            in the Redoran village style, built of local materials, with organic curves and
            undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells of giant native
            insects. Most guildhalls, cornerclubs, and merchants are sited in the southwest corner
            of town, convenient to West Gate and the strider port, while the <location ref="Temple"
                visitable="yes">Temple</location> is located on high ground to the east, and
            surrounded by a residential section.</p>

        <p>
            <location ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn</location>-under-Skar is the most
            distinctive architectural feature of <location ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes"
                >Ald'ruhn</location> -- a manor and council district sheltered beneath the shell of
            an ancient extinct giant crab. The large carapace encloses a central dome, from which
            radiate the entrances to the Redoran Council chambers, the manors of the Redoran
            councilors, and shops of a few upscale merchants.</p>

        <p>
            <location ref="Buckmoth Fort" visitable="yes">Buckmoth Fort</location> is the Imperial
            legion garrison for the district. The strong walls and towers of this Western fortress
            lies a short distance to the south of <location ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes"
                >Ald'ruhn</location> town, through South Gate behind the Mages Guild.</p>

        <p> Services</p>
        <p> House Redoran services are in the Council House and Councilor's Manors of <location
                ref="Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar</location>. The
                <location ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn</location>
            <location ref="Temple" visitable="yes">Temple</location> on the east side of town
            provides service for <location ref="Temple" visitable="yes">Temple</location>
            worshipers. <location ref="Buckmoth Fort" visitable="yes">Buckmoth Fort</location>
            offers services to the Imperial Legion and devotees of the Imperial cult, including an
            Imperial cult altar. The guildhalls of the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild are near the
            South Gate. Pricy but high-quality clothier, alchemist, and enchanter shops are under
            Skar as well. Commodities at reasonable prices, but with smaller selections, are
            available from the smith, clothier, trader, pawnbroker, and bookseller near the entrance
            to <location ref="Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar</location>.
            The <location ref="Ald Skar Inn" visitable="yes">Ald Skar Inn</location> and the
                <location ref="Council Club cornerclub" visitable="yes">Council Club
                cornerclub</location> are found to the west, near West Gate and the silt strider
            port. <location ref="The Rat in the Pot" visitable="yes">The Rat in the Pot</location>
            cornerclub is in south <location ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn</location>,
            near the guildhalls.</p>

        <p> Travel and Transportation</p>
        <p> Roads lead northwest to <location ref="Maar Gan" visitable="yes">Maar Gan</location> and
                <location ref="Gnisis" visitable="yes">Gnisis</location> villages and by a
            circuitous western route to <location ref="Caldera" visitable="yes">Caldera</location>,
                <location ref="Balmora" visitable="yes">Balmora</location>, and points south. The
            road to <location ref="Balmora" visitable="yes">Balmora</location> swings northwest to
            avoid the barren wastes, and curves around towards the west until it heads south again
            to <location ref="Caldera" visitable="yes">Caldera</location>. Between <location
                ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes">Ald'ruhn</location> and <location ref="Caldera"
                visitable="yes">Caldera</location> are many sidepaths; watch for signposts, or
            you'll get lost. The silt strider port is along the western town wall, north of West
            Gate. Silt strider service goes from <location ref="Ald'ruhn" visitable="yes"
                >Ald'ruhn</location> to <location ref="Balmora" visitable="yes">Balmora</location>,
                <location ref="Gnisis" visitable="yes">Gnisis</location>, <location ref="Khuul"
                visitable="yes">Khuul</location>, or <location ref="Maar Gan" visitable="yes">Maar
                Gan</location>.. Guild guides at the Mages Guild teleport you to <location
                ref="Balmora" visitable="yes">Balmora</location>, <location ref="Vivec City"
                visitable="yes">Vivec City</location>, <location ref="Caldera" visitable="yes"
                >Caldera</location>, and <location ref="Sadrith Mora" visitable="yes">Sadrith
                Mora</location> for a modest fee. Gnaar Mok is a LONG and exceptionally unpleasant
            walk west to the coast and then south; there are no trails or marked routes. Casual
            travelers ill-equipped for the attacks of wild beasts and brigands should keep to the
            roads and travel services.</p>
