      <p> Lord <span class="person" id="">Nerevar Indoril</span>, Hail <span class="location" id="Resdaynia">Resdaynia</span> My Lord, Friend, and Companion
         </p>
      
      
      <p>  Once we were friends and
         brothers, Lord <span class="person">Nerevar</span>, in peace and in war. No houseman ever served you better, or more
         faithfully. Much that I did was at your command, at great cost to myself, and my honor.
         Yet
         beneath <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>, you struck me down as I guarded the treasure you bound me by oath to
         defend. It was a cruel blow, a bitter betrayal, to be felled by your hand.</p>
      
      
      <p>  But, remembering our old friendship, I would forgive you, and raise you high in
         my service. The <span class="group" id="">Sixth House</span> was not
         dead, but only sleeping. Now we wake from our long dream, coming forth to free <span class="location">Morrowind</span> of
         foreign rulers and divine pretenders. When the land is swept clean of false friends
         and greedy
         thieves, the children of <span class="person">Veloth</span> will build anew a garden of plenty in this <span class="location">blighted wasteland</span>.
         Come to <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>, old friend. For the fellowship and honor that once we shared, I would
         grant you counsel and power, if only you would pledge that friendship anew. The path
         to <span class="location">Red
            Mountain</span> is long, and filled with danger, but if you are worthy, you will find there wisdom,
         a
         firm friend, and all the power you need to set the world aright. </p>
      
      
      <p> As ever, your respectful servant and loyal friend, 
         Lord <span class="person">Voryn Dagoth</span>, <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span> 
         </p>
