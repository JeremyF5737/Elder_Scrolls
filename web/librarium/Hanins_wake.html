      <h1>Hanin's Wake</h1>

         <li>Balmora: Visitable? yes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p> ...and upon that year of the Reign of <span class="person" id="Wulfharth">Wulfharth</span> and his Son's, the Magnificence that
         was Mordrin Hanin ended in this world. Representative of <span class="location">Ashalmawia</span>, <span class="location">Maelkashishi</span> and <span class="location">Ald Sotha</span> gathered in a great host at the vastness of <span class="location">Assurnabitashpi</span>. Even Hilbongard and
         Dorach Gusal were lured from their Forge, and for a time the Fires of <span class="location">Anudnabia</span> were silent.
         </p>
      
      
      <p> And thus on the Ninth Day of Mourning, many slaves and enemies were sacrificed and
         the Cup
         of Passage was mixed according to the direction of Hanin's Formulae:</p>
      
      
      <p> 2 Parts Blood of Traitors
         1 Part <span class="item" id="daedrasheart">Daedra's Heart</span> of <span class="group" id="Daedra">Daedra</span>
         1 Part mixed Bittergreen Petals, <span class="item">Void Salts</span>, <span class="item">Green
            Lichens</span> and <span class="item">Bonemeal</span>
         1 Part <span class="item">Moonsugar</span> 
         5 Parts <span class="item">Flin</span></p>
      
      
      <p> Combine Blood, <span class="item">Heart</span>, <span class="item">Moonsugar</span> in Large Ebony <span class="item">Alembic</span>. Heat fire fed by Bones of Traitors. Condense vapors into a large Ebony flask.
         For a hot drink, strain contents through <span class="item">Scamp Skin</span> and mix with <span class="item">Flin</span> in large mug, slowly
         stirring with a glass rod. For a chilled drink, mix in flask with pure <span class="location">Skyrim</span> Ice and shake
         vigorously. Strain through <span class="person">Winged Twilight</span> membrane and served in gem encrusted goblet. 
         </p>
      
      
      <p>The wake was considered a great success as the beverage killed a great many guests
         and thus
         Mordrin Hanin was supplied with companions in the next world.</p> </body>
