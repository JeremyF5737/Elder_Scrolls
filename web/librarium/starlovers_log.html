      <p>6th moon ....... "Alas, the <span class="location" id="ImperialBattlespire">Battlespire</span> appears to be falling into the hands of evil. Their many attempts in the past have
         failed, until now. <span class="person" id="MehrunesDagon">Dagon</span> seems to have new minions at his side this time. These new horrors are not at all
         too powerful beyond our magicks and weaponry, but their numbers are feverishly great.
         We grow low on supplies and soldiers for this holdout. I fear the worst."</p>
      
      
      <p>8th moon ....... "I have presented to the few remaining <span class="group" id="Battlemages">Battlemages</span> my last hope plan. I will fight my way to the bowells of the <span class="location">Battlespire</span>, where I will mount <span class="person">Dragonne Papré</span>, my <span class="person">Dragon</span> companion. From his lair, we will take flight. Since the <span class="location">Weir Gate</span> has been taken, teleportation is not possible. Only <span class="person">Papré</span> can make such a journey to the <span class="location">Imperial Palace</span>. There, we will report the evil infection and return with a regimental force of rescue.
         May the Powers be with me."</p>
      
      
      <p>9th moon........ "It is as I feared. A carcass is all I have come to find. They have
         sealed the main gate so <span class="person">Papré</span> could not escape. I am not sorrowful though, for I will be eternally reunited with
         <span class="person">Dragonne Papré</span>. Hope for the living is lost. My name is <span class="person">Samar Starlover</span>. Tell my sister I am dead, and if all the seas were ink, I could not write enough
         how I shall miss her."</p>
