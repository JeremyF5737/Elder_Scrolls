      <p>Listen, faithful, to Vivec's words, for he says five times and five ways --</p>
      
      <p>Forge a keen Faith in the crucible of suffering.</p>
      
      <p>Engrave upon thy eye the image of injustice.</p>
      
      <p>Death does not diminish; the ghost gilds with glory.</p>
      
      <p>Faith conquers all. Let us yield to Faith.</p>
      
      <p>Better to suffer a wrong than to do one.</p>
      
      
      <p> Hear the words of <span class="person" id="Vivec">Lord Vivec</span>, and heed his sermons on the Seven Graces, for he names them seven times and seven
         ways --</p>
