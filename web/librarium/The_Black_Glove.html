      <p>Swift and agile are the <span class="group" id="Morag_Tong">Morag Tong</span>. Silent and unseen they move. Illusions they supply to misdirect their prey. Close
         and sure they strike with shortblade, or distant and secure they strike from afar
         with accurate missile fire. Light armor protects them from harm, and the acrobatic
         discipline finds for them the unseen and unlooked-for path. Have you these virtues?
         Then, perhaps, your oath and service may please the <span class="group">Morag Tong</span>.</p>
      
      <p>Do you have your friends and your finery, but no place to go? Do you laugh and cry,
         but no longer feel? Do you wear these masks? Then, perhaps, your oath and service
         may please the Black Glove.</p>
      
      <p>The blood of the hunter and the blood of the hunted. The joy of the hidden and the
         joy of the seeker. The blood of the eye and the blood of the gate. The joy of the
         living and the joy of the dead. Are you one with these things? Then, perhaps, your
         oath and service may please <span class="person" id="Mephala">Mephala</span>.</p>
      
      <p>To make your oath and enter our service, the worthy must seek the <span class="person">Grandmaster</span>, who by tradition lives in the unseen and unlooked-for corners of <span class="location">Vivec City</span> between the blood of battle and the waters of life.</p>
