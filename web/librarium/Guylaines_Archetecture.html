      <p>"The Test of Pattern requires the observer to examine and analyze for patterns before
         he
         acts, with the understanding that many patterns are subtle or hidden.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The Test of Disorder requires the observer to proceed systematically when no pattern
         is perceived. When
         the observer recognizes that many things must be done, and in no specific order; the
         procedure is to perceive and order all the things to be done, and, upon doing a thing,
         to
         recall how and when that thing has been done. For example, the observer must remember
         the
         initial position of a thing, and also the new position of that thing.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"The Test of Evasion requires the observer to examine the obstacle, and compare his
         resources and abilities; if
         the obstacle is too difficult, seek for a path around the difficulty.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"The Test ofConfrontation requires the observer to examine the obstacle, and compare
         his resources and
         abilities; if the obstacle is too difficult, look for a path around the difficulty...
         but if
         no path around can be found, confront the obstacle directly."</p>
