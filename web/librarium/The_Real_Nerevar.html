      <p>The Real  <span class="person" id="Nerevar">Nerevar</span>: A <span class="group" id="Telvanni">Telvanni</span> retainer's informal history of  <span class="person">Nerevar</span></p>
      
      <p>In that time, House <span class="group">Dwemer</span> were great enchanters, so  <span class="person">Nerevar</span> went in secret to a <span class="group">Dwemer</span> smith and asked for an enchanted ring that would help him. The ring gave its wearer
         great powers of persuasion; for safety, it was enchanted to instantly kill anyone
         who wore it except  <span class="person">Nerevar</span>. The ring was called <span class="item" id="moon-and-star">Moon-and-Star</span>, and it helped  <span class="person">Nerevar</span> unite the various clans into the <span class="group">First Council</span>.</p>
      
      <p>Later, however, disputes over religion divided the Council, with House <span class="group">Dwemer</span> and House <span class="group">Dagoth</span> on one side and all the other Houses on the other. <span class="group">Dwemer</span> and <span class="group">Dagoth</span> invited <span class="group">Orc</span> and <span class="group">Nord</span> clans as allies, and held northwest Morrowind, while  <span class="person">Nerevar</span> mustered the other Houses and <span class="group">nomad tribes</span> and marched to meet the <span class="group">Dwemer</span>-<span class="group">Dagoth</span>-Westerner forces.</p>
      
      <p>The armies met at <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>, a <span class="group">Dwemer</span> stronghold. The <span class="group">Dwemer</span> were defeated, with great slaughter, and terrible sorceries were used, resulting
         in the utter extermination of House <span class="group">Dwemer</span>, House <span class="group">Dagoth</span>, and their allies.  <span class="person">Nerevar</span> was killed in the battle, and his ring lost, but  <span class="person">Nerevar</span>'s alliance survives in Morrowind's ruling political institution, the <span class="group">Grand Council</span>.</p>
