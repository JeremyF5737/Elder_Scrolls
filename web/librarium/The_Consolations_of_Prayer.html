         or in the tomb of the sanctified.</p>
      
      
      <p>What benefits may be gained shall be listed herein for the edification of the worshipper
         and pilgrim.</p>
      
      
      <p>All shrines grant cures of common diseases, of blight diseases, and of afflictions
         of poison.</p>
      
      
      <p>Those shrines bearing the images of <span class="person">Vivec</span>, <span class="person">Almalexia</span>, and <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span> also may grant the blessing of <span class="person">Almsivi</span> Restoration, which restores damaged attributes, and the three blessings of <span class="person">Almsivi</span>: <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s Mystery, for good fortune; Soul of <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span>, for magical power, and Lady's Grace, for endurance of hardships.</p>
      
      
      <p>Those shrines bearing the images of the saints may also grant the particular blessings
         of the saints, which are listed for you here:</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">St. Aralor</span> grants Aralor's Intervention, for fortifying character.</p>

      <p>The Faithful are granted these blessings when they pray at the shrines and make a
         modest donation. The Blessed of the Initiate rank and higher of the Temple have already
         made their devotions in service and piety, and need only pray at the shrines to receive
         their benefits. And <span class="person">Almsivi</span> is generous, so even the Unbeliever may receive a blessing if he prays, if he proves
         his respect with a generous donation.</p>
