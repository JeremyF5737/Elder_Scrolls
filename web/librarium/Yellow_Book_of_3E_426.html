      <p>King Hlaalu <span class="person">Athyn Llethan</span>, High Councilor and Lord of Morrowind, grants relief to merchants complaining of
         high tariffs on imported alcoholic beverages.</p>
      
      
      <p>The council is pleased to report a reduction in the incidence of theft and violent
         crime in the Hlaalu House Districts, thanks to the vigilance of the Legions and stern
         sentences by the magistrates. The council laments the unfortunate disturbances of
         the public peace resulting from the increasingly aggressive competition between the
         <span class="group">Thieves Guild</span> and the <span class="group">Camonna Tong</span> for control of the black markets.</p>
      
      
      <p>A minor tax revolt in <span class="location">Balmora</span> was suppressed without undue harm to life and property. The council sent deputations
         to the Duke to express their concerns over the high tax rates and the injurious effect
         of high tariffs on trade.</p>
