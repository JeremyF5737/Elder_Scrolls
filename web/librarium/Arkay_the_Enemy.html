      <p>Hear me, children. Once I was a lowly man such as yourselves. By my will I entered
         the ranks
         of the <span class="group" id="gods">gods</span>. By your unquestioning devotion, you can share my glory.</p>
      
      
      <p>Most <span class="group">Necromancers</span> are fools and weaklings. Fodder for the <span class="group">witchhunters</span>. But you, my servants,
         you are among the chosen. In the days to come, few will dare to stand against your
         might.
         But one obstacle remains. His name is <span class="person" id="Arkay">Arkay</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>He was also a man who entered the ranks of the <span class="group">gods</span>. The similarities between his mortal life
         and my own astonish even me. It is only proper that we should be enemies.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Arkay's</span> Blessing prevents the souls of men, <span class="group">beastmen</span>, and <span class="group">elves</span> from being used without
         consent. <span class="person">Arkay's</span> Law prevents those buried with the proper rituals from being raised to
         serve my children's will. As you know, my children, <span class="person">Arkay's</span> Blessing is flexible to those
         with daring, but <span class="person">Arkay's</span> Law is unwavering.</p>
      
      
      <p>To the Scholars: Humiliate the priests of <span class="person">Arkay</span>. Reveal the primitive burial customs to be
         mere superstition. Befriend kings with honeyed words and bind them to your will. Look
         to my
         children in <span class="location">Cyrodiil</span> for guidance.</p>
      
      
      <p>To the Priests: Use your servants sparingly, let none be seen by the living. Let the
         memories
         of the undead waste away from the people. Send missionaries to the unbound dead, to
         the
         Vampires and the Liches. Let all the nations of dead carry my banner and my banner
         alone.</p>
      
      
      <p>To the Hidden: Wait, as always, in the darkness.</p>
      
      
      <p>For soon we shall strike. The Temples of <span class="person">Arkay</span> will be torn stone from stone. The blood of
         his priests will sate our thirst; their bones will rise as our servants. The name
         <span class="person">Arkay</span> will
         be stuck [sic] from the records. Only I shall hold sway over life and death. Only
         one name
         shall be whispered in fear. The name of your lord and master.</p>
