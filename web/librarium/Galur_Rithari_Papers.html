      <p>"Outnumbered and isolated, I yielded to my foe. The creature dressed like a gentleman,
         and I hoped for honorable treatment. Instead, I found myself a feast for a
         blood-drinking monster.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Shamed by my corruption, and despairing of my own welfare, I passively acquiesced
         in my
         gradual integration into the affairs of <span class="group" id="ClanAundae">Clan Aundae</span>. I made no human my prey, only
         beasts, and kept myself apart from the other clankin; nonetheless, I abandoned hope
         and
         lived like a beast.</p>
      
      
      <p> "Drawn by intimations of my former life, I visited my former post at <span class="location">Bal Ur</span>, hoping
         perhaps to atone in some for my crimes by preying upon its monsters, or perishing
         under
         their attacks. It is there that, by chance, I made petition to the Lord of Troubles,
         <span class="person" id="MolagBal">Molag Bal</span>, at an altar deep in the caverns beneath the pilgrim's shrine. I was
         surprised, and thrilled, and terrified, when <span class="person">Molag Bal</span>, or some aspect or agent of that
         Daedra Lord, offered me a chance to cure myself of vampirism, in return for a favor.
         However, with no hope for my soul or spirit unless I might be cured, I undertook his
         quest.</p>
      
      
      <p>[Rithari sought and obtained a cursed soul gem of mysterious nature from a deep cavern
         on
         the northern slopes of <span class="location">Dagoth Ur</span>, delivering it to <span class="person">Molag Bal's</span> shrine in <span class="location">Bal Ur</span>.]</p>
      
      
      <p>"I placed the gem within the basin before the altar, and instantly experienced a blinding
         of pain and terror that I cannot express in words, except that it seemed afterward
         that
         I had been asleep and dreaming that I was being sliced by thousands of tiny knives
         from
         my bowels inside out. I awoke before the altar, and gazed in the reflection of my
         own
         sword blade at my own face - no longer a blood-seeking beast of teeth and empty
         eyes."</p>
