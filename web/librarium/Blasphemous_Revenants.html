      <p>...not into the world, nor out of it, but between worlds they linger, held to the
         hearth and tomb by blood and loyalty. And if they 
         come unbidden, from love of kin or faith to duty, it is not unholy. It is but the
         answering of the ancestors, the awakening of 
         those who never sleep, the summoning to service of those bound through Hearth and
         House to the protection of the clan.</p>
      
      
      <p>But if sorcerers bring them forth, then such a summons is blasphemy, an abomination
         before the <span class="group" id="Ashlander">Tribes</span> and <span class="location">Temple</span>, and a 
         sin so great that ages of burning cannot cleanse the fault. Abide not the sorcerer
         among you, for he comes to steal the bones 
         of your fathers and dust of your tombs. He seeks to bind by power what is yours by
         right, to drag forth the warm spirits from 
         their world between and bind them to their service like slaves and beasts.</p>
      
      
      <p>Who can know the shame of the dead, the ceaseless weeping of the necromancer's thrall?
         Cruel enough is the ancestor's 
         service given in love to Hearth and Kin. But <span class="group">ghost</span> or <span class="group">guardian</span>, <span class="group">bonewalker</span> or <span class="group">bonelord</span>, summoned by profane ritual and 
         bound by force to the corpse miner's will, how may such a spirit ever find rest? How
         may it ever find its way back to its blood 
         and clan?</p>
      
      
      <p>Only a righteous <span class="group">Dunmer</span>, bound by blood to hearth and kin, bound by oath and service to the Temple, can call
         upon the 
         spirits of the Dunmer dead. Those foreign sorcerers of other races that invade our
         shores, shall they be permitted to rob our 
         tombs, to bind our kin-spirits into sorcerous slavery, to steal the lives of our dead
         as well as our land of the living? No, I say, 
         no, and no, three times more. Such necromancers must die, and their profane magicks
         must die with them.</p>
      
      
      <p>And shall we tolerate the hidden hosts of the undead, the arrogant princes of necromancers,
         the ancient <span class="group">vampire</span> demons 
         who creep from their lairs in the West, seeking refuge in profane Daedric shrines,
         abandoned Dunmer Strongholds, 
         and corrupted subterranean labyrinths of the detested <span class="group">Dwemer</span> race? For ages the Great Houses and the Temple have kept our 
         land clean of the vampire's taint, but now these undead lords and their vile cattle
         have returned. These vampires die, and 
         their corrupt cattle with them, and their blood taint must be forever erased by fire
         and stake.</p>
