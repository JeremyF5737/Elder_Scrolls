      <p>Fresh and decayed corpses are those that still have flesh upon them. If their decay
         is
         advanced, or if you wish a skeletal servant instead, place the corpse along a coast
         or
         in a swamp or marsh. Animals are the Necromancer's greatest allies when it comes to
         stripping the flesh from a corpse. The ravenous mudcrabs of <span class="location">Morrowind</span> can strip a corpse down to its bones in a
         matter of days. Lesser crabs in other provinces can do the same in a matter of
         weeks.</p>
      
      
      <p> If you wish to create a <span class="group" id="zombie">zombie</span> servant, one need only bring the corpse to a suitable
         site and enact the proper rituals. However, there are a few tips that a young
         Necromancer might want to know. For instance, a decayed servant may be raised many
         times, even if they have been dismembered by those who do not appreciate our Art.
         If one
         of your servants comes to an unfortunate end, you may raise the servant again by
         carefully gathering as many parts as you can find, binding the bones with leather
         straps, and sewing the flesh (if it not too decayed) with catgut. Your servant may
         be
         weaker each time this is done, but with care and maintenance, one may raise <span class="group">zombies</span>
         dozens of times.</p>
      
      
      <p>However, creating a mere <span class="group">zombie</span> is a method best left to lazy or desperate practitioners.
         With only a bit more time and effort, one may create a far more useful mummified
         servant.</p>
      
      
      <p>The first step to creating a mummified servant is to soak the decaying corpse in a
         bath
         of salt or natron for at least one month. This will halt the decay of the corpse,
         and if
         the corpse is fresh enough to have an unpleasant odor, the salts will remove that
         as
         well. In a moist climate, such as Argonian or <span class="location">Thras</span>, you may have to apply more salts if
         they become saturated. Some Necromancers remove the vital organs before or after this
         process, but I have never found any practical reason for doing this.</p>
      
      
      <p>The next step is to wrap the servant in cloth or linen. This will further preserve
         the
         body against decay and, if done properly, will offer some protection as well. Do not
         worry if the corpse seems too stiff or desiccated to be a useful servant, the proper
         rituals will imbue the mummified corpse with the strength to move itself. Most
         importantly, you will have a much stronger servant who will follow your commands with
         more independence and understanding.</p>
