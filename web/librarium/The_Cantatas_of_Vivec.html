      <p>        [The Cantatas of <span class="person" id="Vivec">Vivec</span> are gospels written in the form of epic songs. They trace the evolution of <span class="person">Vivec</span> from a foolish mortal into an enlightened divine. <span class="person">Vivec</span> sought out experiences that tested him in every way possible, particularly in the
         defense and protection of his <span class="group" id="Dark_Elves">Dunmer</span> people, and through his long life, his humility, and his unconquerable spirit, he
         attained the Wisdom of the Seven Graces. The Cantatas relate many stories of <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s experiments with challenge and risk, his failures and triumphs, his blessings of
         insight and good fortune, and his debt to his partners, <span class="person">Almalexia</span> the Lover and <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span> the Teacher. The poetry is simple and dramatic, lyric and personal, composed to be
         sung or recited. The following is an excerpt from Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s 'Brooding Beneath <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>'.]</p>
      
      
      <p>The gaunt ghostfires loom as subtle shrouds,</p>
      
      
      <p>Smokes and shades on the biers of <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Arches and spires line the rock halls,</p>
      
      
      <p>Dimly lit by the spirits of the dead.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>The blood of broken hearths and houses</p>
      
      
      <p>Runs in red rivers, blossoms in fountains.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Girdled round within walls of wit's glass</p>
      
      
      <p>The shattered hosts slumber in cradles of ash.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>But when shall they wake?</p>
      
      
      <p>What dark crucible may kindle their souls to light?</p>
      
      
      
      <p>How long beneath red-reeking clouds</p>
      
      
      <p>Must flickering watchfires burn?</p>
      
      
      
      <p>How many lifetimes of labor and lament</p>
      
      
      <p>Will it take to seal this restless tomb?</p>
