      <p>The <span class="item" id="poppy">Poppy</span>, both black and white, can be found growing wild in the mountains of <span class="location">Hammerfell</span>. Their succulent pods are often the only nourishment of adventurers who find themselves
         in the wilderness without rations. It is said that the black and white <span class="item">poppies</span> together have magical properties. When they are crushed and mixed with the milk of

      <p><span class="item">Fire Fern</span>, a perennial herb, native to <span class="location">Morrowind</span>. The flowers are inconspicuous and often hidden. The glossy, evergreen foliage and
         flowers are resistant to the conditions of high heat and bright light. A petal from

         and fire found in the lava pits and streams found around <span class="location">Dagoth-Ur</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="item">Dragon's-Tongue</span>, common name for a fern like herb found in <span class="location">Black Marsh</span>. It is especially prolific around the area of <span class="location">Utherus Swamp</span>. It is a beautiful wildflower. Its name comes from the fire red fronds that protect
         its golden flower. As pretty as it is, it is a deadly poison to most living beings
         and needs to be avoided by adventurers. It is said, however, that <span class="group" id="Argonians">Argonians</span> can pick the plant and use the sap derived from its roots as an enhancement to their
         endurance.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="item">Domica Redwort</span> is a herb grown by many residents of <span class="location">Valenwood</span> for their beautiful and showy flowers. They attain a height of about three feet and
         have feathery leaves; the flowers are usually bright red. In addition to their beauty,
         they are said to have magical abilities to enhance the appearance of anyone who carries
         or wears one of the flowers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="item">Ironwood Nut</span>, this rare nut comes from the Ironwood trees which grow deep in the forests of <span class="location">Skyrim</span>. The wood from these trees is as hard as the metal for which they are named. The
         very rare black ironwood tree is said to produce a nut which is very succulent and
         is believed to enhance the strength of the adventurer who is able to crack its shell.</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="item">Ginko leaves</span> which are found along the banks of rivers and lakes in <span class="location">Hammerfell</span> are most inconspicuous, only its peculiar halfmoon shape makes it noticeable. It
         is very sweet and tasty. Legend has it that when mixed properly with the pulp of the
         Aloe plant, the potion has the ability to increase one's stamina for a short while.</p>

         be very difficult, but once retrieved it can be used to put an enemy to sleep for
         a short while by passing it under his nose.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="item">Arrowroot </span>is a thick, rubbery tuber that can be found in the Province of <span class="location">Valenwood</span>. The plant is very difficult to find as its above ground foliage is very meager and
         scrawny. But the <span class="item">Arrowroot </span>itself can be most beneficial to the gatherer as it has magical properties. The paste
         made from grinding the root is very tasty and can improve the user's accuracy with
