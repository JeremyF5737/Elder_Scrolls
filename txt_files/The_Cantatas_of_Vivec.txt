The gaunt ghostfires loom as subtle shrouds,

Smokes and shades on the biers of Red Mountain.


Arches and spires line the rock halls,

Dimly lit by the spirits of the dead.


The blood of broken hearths and houses

Runs in red rivers, blossoms in fountains.


Girdled round within walls of wit's glass

The shattered hosts slumber in cradles of ash.


But when shall they wake?

What dark crucible may kindle their souls to light?


How long beneath red-reeking clouds

Must flickering watchfires burn?


How many lifetimes of labor and lament

Will it take to seal this restless tomb?
