Dear Sir,

I have received your order for a single-sized bed and have requested that one be delivered straight from my supplier in Sadrith Mora. Assuming the raiding parties don't get to it, it should arrive shortly within a fortnight. I hope you enjoy your new residence in Vos and if there is anything else I can help you with, do not hesitate to let me know.

Berwen
